If a model fits the current sample well, how can we trust that it will make good predictions on new data? As you'll see [later on](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/regularization-for-simplicity/l2-regularization), overfitting is caused by making a model more complex than necessary. The fundamental tension of machine learning is between fitting our data well, but also fitting the data as simply as possible.\n",

Unfortunately, the model can't see the whole truth; the model can only sample from a training data set. If a model fits the current examples well, how can you trust the model will also make good predictions on never-before-seen examples?\n",
