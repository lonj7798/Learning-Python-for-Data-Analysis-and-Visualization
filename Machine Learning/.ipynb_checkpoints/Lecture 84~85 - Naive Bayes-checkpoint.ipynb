It proves to be quite robust to irrelevant features, which it ignores. It learns and predicts very fast and it does not require lots of storage. So, why is it then called naive?\n",

    "Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. Given a class variable y and a dependent feature vector x<sub>1<\\sub> through x<sub>n</sub>, Bayes’ theorem states the following relationship:\n",

    "### Step 5: Constructing a classifier from the probability model\n",
    "So far we have derived the independent feature model, the Naive Bayes probability model. The Naive Bayes classifier combines this model with a decision rule, this decision rule will decide which hypothesis is most probable, in our example case this will be which class of flower is most probable.\n",

    "Picking the hypothesis that is most probable is known as the maximum a posteriori or MAP decision rule. The corresponding classifier, a Bayes classifier, is the function that assigns a class label to y as follows:\n",

We first segment the data by the class, and then compute the mean and variance of x in each class. Let μc be the mean of the values in x associated with class c, and let σ2c be the variance of the values in x associated with class c. Then, the probability distribution of some value given a class, p(x=v|c), can be computed by plugging v into the equation for a Normal distribution parameterized by μ<sub>c</sub> and σ<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub>.
